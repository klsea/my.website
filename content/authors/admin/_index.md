Kendra Seaman is an Assistant Professor at The University of Texas at Dallas. She completed her BA in psychology and biology at the University of Kansas before joining Teach For America. After teaching in Oakland, CA and Washington, DC, she completed a Masterâ€™s and PhD at The Catholic University of America and  a postdoc in the Motivated Cognition and Aging Brain Lab with Gregory Samanez-Larkin (at Yale and Duke Universities).

Her research is dedicated to using basic and translational scientific research studies to promote health and wellbeing across adulthood. We use a variety of behavioral, modeling and neuroimaging techniques to better understand how the mind and the brain change as people get older.
